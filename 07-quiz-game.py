# import the following modules: random.shuffle, os.system, csv.reader

# write a method to clear the terminal


# create a list to store names
# import names into that list

# create a list to store majors
# import majors into list


# shuffle lists


# generate list of profiles

# Print that list one by one in the terminal
# Hi, I'm ___ and I study ____
# Prompt the user to press any key to meet the next person
# Clear the terminal when they do

# set up a variable to track total profiles
# set up a variable to track total answers
# set up a variable to track total correct answers
# using the above, set up a variable to calculate incorrect answers
# using the above, set up a variable to calculate remaining questions

# shuffle the deck of profiles


# Loop throught profiles and doas follows

# ask the user about who has a particular major

# get their answer through input

# add 1 to the number of answers

# compare their answer to the acctual value
# if it's correct,
# Ler the user know their answer was correct
# increment the correct counter

# if not
# Let the user know their answer was NOT correct
# Show them the correct answer

# if not, show them the correct answer

# print results so far "Score: x/y"
# Check if there are remaining questions

# If so,
# let then know how many are remaining
# Prompt the user to press any key to meet the next person
# Clear the terminal when they do
# if not,
# Than them for playing


# Bonus Step
# There will likely be a lot of repeated code in the first version of this program
# See how you can optimize it by abstrating some of the steps into resulable methods
